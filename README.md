# little shutdown program

Just a little program, that shuts down a (Windows) computer after a from the user set countdown is done.

## What is my purpose

It's perfect for just lying in your bed and for example hearing music on your computer until the countdown is done and the computer automatically turns itself off.

## Development state

- at the moment it only works on windows (only tested there)
- there is a lot of copied code ðŸ™ˆ

## Reasons for existing

Iiiiiii just made this program because I'm too lazy to get up after I laid down, but to lie in bed without music is meh and headphones are also :/ and since I currently don't have any other (good) music system this was my solution for the *problem*.

## Disclaimer

This program is currently not perfect or has many feautures.
It's just a timer for shutting the system off.
Maybe - if it's possible - I add that it *shuts down if the  song ends* or something like that, but right now this is very unrealistic .
