# little shutdown program
just a little program, that should run on full screen and counting down a Timer that the User has set and then the system shuts down. -perfect for just laying in bed and hearing the last song on the laptop and then it shut down itself.
~at the moment it only should work on windows. And i think in it's first version there will be copied a lot of codeðŸ™ˆ
