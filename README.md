## How does it look like

### Main screen

From here you can set the time of the timer and start/stop, pause/resume it and also clear your input and the current timer.

### Settings and About screen

You can get to the settings screen by clicking the settings icon in the title bar (first icon from the left). If you click the 'i' you get to the about screen. To get back home simply press either of the icons again.

Also there is the option to minimze the window to the system tray or dis-/enable a native window title bar and menu if you do not like the default custom title bar.

## Start/Run/Edit/Build it yourself

To build/run/edit the program you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Then you need to open this directory in your console and run the follwing command to isntall all dependencies:

``` bash
npm install
```

### Start/Run

``` bash
npm start
```

### Build

``` bash
.\build.sh
```

or

``` bash
npx electron-builder . --win
```

### Edit

We used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing/creating this project because of the many helping plugins for linting and auto formatting our code and the integrated console.

#### Code style

If you edit code, please check that your code style is [JavaScript standard](https://standardjs.com/). Thanks to eslint you can before you commit clean all your code to this style guide by running:

```bash
eslint FILE --fix
```

To use this command you need to install the `eslint` module with the command:

```bash
npm install eslint -g
```

There is even an script named [`eslintJsFiles.sh`](eslintJsFiles.sh) which can be run and then automatically fixes the code style in all files.
