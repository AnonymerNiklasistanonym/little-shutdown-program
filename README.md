# little shutdown program
just a little program, that should run on full screen and counting down a Timer that the User has set and then the system shuts down. 

-perfect for just laying in bed and hearing the last song on the laptop and then it shuts down itself.
~at the moment it only should work on windows. And i think in it's first version there will be copied a lot of codeðŸ™ˆ

Aaaand this program i just make because i'm too lazy to stand of after i laid down and laying down without music is meh and headphones are also :/ and i since yet i don't have any other (good) music system.

-this program should not be perfect or complete or many functionality. Just a timer for shutting the system off. Maybe, idk if it's possible it would be nice to just make the selection that says "Shut down if the Song ends" or something like that, but it sounds unrealistic atm.
