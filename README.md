## What is my purpose

It's perfect for just lying in your bed and for example hearing music on your computer until the countdown is done and the computer automatically turns itself off.

## Development state

Only tested on Windows, but there everything works

## Reasons for existing

Iiiiiii just made this program because I'm too lazy to get up after I laid down, but to lie in bed without music is meh and headphones are also :/ and since I currently don't have any other (good) music system this was my solution for the *problem*.

## Disclaimer

This program is not perfect and was not written by professionals.
