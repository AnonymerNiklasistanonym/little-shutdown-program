# <p align="center">little shutdown program</p>

Just a little program, that shuts down a (Windows 10) computer after a, from the user set, countdown is finished. The program is basically written with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).

##How does it look like

Here's a screenshot of this beautiful program:

-> functions should be self-explaining ^^

Here's a Screenshot from the Setting Page:

The only thing that may seem strange is the Spotify Logo and the Spotify Setting. It has to do with the feature of the program, that it automatically stops your actual playing Spotify Song, when the Timer ends.

##Installation

Just go to the [GitHub Release Site](https://github.com/undefinedCoding/little-shutdown-program/releases) from this Project and download the latest release.

Then double-click the File `little-shutdown-program Setup 0.0.9.exe`. After a short Time the program is installed and you can start it like any other program on your (Windows) Computer.
